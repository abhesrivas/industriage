Session 1: 10.32 PM in Windsurf
--------------------------------
- Thinking on the project organization, there are two workflows but I should probably come up with a single base framework

11:55 PM
--------------------------------
- Initial commit with some errors done
- Need to check why agents are not returning any output
- Need to add more eval metrics, can directly compare certain fields like ("personnel") but might need to utilize LLM-based metrics for fields like "Title"
- LLM as a judge could be an option with manual review for cases that throw off even a single error
- Dashboard should be interactive and allow for drill-down into the results
